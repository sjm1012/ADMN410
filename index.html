        <h1>About us</h1>
		<h2>History</h2>
		
        <p>Durham House of Pets, formerly known as Durham Pet Depot, is home to all of your pet needs. We were founded in 2009 by Rodger Smith and his wife, Daisy. The couple noticed that there was a lack of pet stores
      near their Durham home, and decided they would fill that need for their friends and neighbors. They started small, selling homemade dog and cat toys, as well as some homemade dog treats and catnip. Today, they operate 
      their shop in a two level house turned storefront in downtown Durham.</p>
      <h2>Why use us</h2>
            <p>We offer a wide selection of organic dog and cat food and treats. We also offer chew toys you can feel good about giving to your best friend. We offer a worry free guarantee with all of your product,
      so if your pet doesn’t like your choice, you can bring it back and we'll refund your purchase. For full details on this policy, please see our in store brochures. Our friendly and knowledgeable staff will be 
      happy to help you find the perfect item for your furry friend.</p>
