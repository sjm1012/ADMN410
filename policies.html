      <h1>Policies</h1>
      <h2>Financing</h2>
      For larger purchases, such as snake tanks, we offer a variety of financing options to fit just about every budget. We will work with you to ensure your pet can have the most comfortable home, and that the purchase won’t break the bank.
      <h2>Delivery</h2>
      Delivery is only eligible for financeable purchases. You do not have to finance a purchase in order to have it delivered, but it does need to be eligible for the service. Special fees apply.
      <h2>Returns</h2>
      All unopened food and toys are eligible for returns within 30 days accompanied by a receipt. We can not accept opened products because most dogs and cats won’t play with a toy that smells like another animal. 
      Snake tank returns are discussed on a case to case nature.
